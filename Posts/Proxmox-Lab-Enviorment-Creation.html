            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project has a focus on having a safe environment for creating, breaking, and then 
                fixing practically anything you can imagine. Within Proxmox, you can build out a custom 
                infrastructure to recreate any situation you find useful. An important feature that Proxmox 
                can do to ensure the safety of your home network is isolation. Isolation allows everything 
                to stay contained within the boundaries of the virtual network. While this post will not hold 
                your hand and show you how to use Proxmox, it will show you what to build out to create the environment safely.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Before I dive into what my lab’s topology looks like and other detailed specifications, I will 
                first explain what Proxmox is for some of the readers who might not know.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Proxmox is an just an open-source Virtual Environment platform that combines two virtualization 
                technologies: KVM's (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) for virtual machines and LXC's (Linux Containers) 
                for lightweight container-based virtualization. Since it is a type-one hypervisor, we will be able 
                to really dive into some of the more advanced functionalities in the lab.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Below is a topology of my Lab.
            </p>
            <img height="400px" src="../images/Topology_Final.png">
            <br>

            <h2>My Topology Explained</h2>
            <p>
                In the topology, I have my Proxmox enviorment set up in the dotted box. 
                In my physical enviorment, I have a dedicated used corporate Desktop that
                I found on amazon for maybe $100 + tax. This Desktop is plugged into my home router
                via ethernet. Moving on, Proxmox has a very nice feature called a 
                Linux Bridge, which essentially just acts as its own virtual switch. 
                I have my actual Malware Analays 
                Enviorment to the right of the Linux Bridge. From the bridge I am able 
                to assign VLANs to the VMs hooked up to said Linux Bridge. All VMs attached 
                directly to the Bridge are assigned their own IP address on my home network
                
                To the right is my acutal Malware Analaysis Lab enviorment, 
                and to the left are other projects I am working on in the future. Following the line down is 
                a VM called pfSense, which is a firewall that manages the traffic 
                flowing in and out of my Malware Infected Enviorment. 
            </p>
            <p>  
                What’s nice about pfSense is its community forums for guidance as it is used in 
                both home and enterprise environments, so you can find the answer to pretty much 
                any issue/question you might face.
            </p>
            <p>
                One step below our pfSense firewall are 2 VMs, remNUX and FlareVM. Both of these
                VMs allow us to do whats called Static and Dynamic Analysis on any malware sample we throw
                at it. More on this below. 
            </p>

            <h2>pfSense</h2>
            <p>
                I utilize a couple of features in the firewall that serve specific purposes within the environment. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                One of these features is a VPN to route malicious traffic outside my network in a reasonably 
                safe way because the IP address the attackers will see won’t be my own home. This allows me 
                to understand things like what replies are the C2’s giving to the malicious code thus further 
                looking into the dynamic aspect. 

                Another feature is the static rules that can be made to stop traffic all 
                together. I use that when I want all traffic to stay contained within the environment it’s in.
            </p>

            <h2>remNUX</h2>
            <p>
                This is a Linux Distribution that was created to perform analysis on practically anything on a 
                computer. It has a ton of tools that can take hours to understand the full breath of it all. 
                I will dive more into this distro once we get acclimated with the topology and beginning analysis steps.
            </p>

            <h2>FlareVM</h2>
            <p>
                This is just a Windows OS with the “FlareVM” packages installed onto it. Yet another go to set 
                of tools mainly because malware is most commonly exploited on Windows machines.
