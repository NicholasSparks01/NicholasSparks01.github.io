            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Before I dive into what my labs topology looks like and other detailed
                specifications, I will first explain what Proxmox is for some of the 
                readers who might not know. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Proxmox is an open-source Virtual Enviorment platform that combines two 
                virtualization technologies: KVM's (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) for 
                virtual machines and LXC's (Linux Containers) for lightweight 
                container-based virtualization.
                Since it is a type-one hypervisor, We will be able to really dive into some of the
                more advanced functionalities in the lab.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>
                Below is a topology of my Lab.

            <h2>My Topology Explained</h2>
            <p>
                In the topology, I have my Proxmox enviorment set up in the dotted box. 
                In my physical enviorment, I have a dedicated used corporate Desktop that
                I found on amazon for maybe $100 + tax. This Desktop is plugged into my home router
                via ethernet. Moving on, Proxmox has a very nice feature called a 
                Linux Bridge, which essentially just acts as its own virtual switch. 
                I have my actual Malware Analays 
                Enviorment to the right of the Linux Bridge. From the bridge I am able 
                to assign VLANs to the VMs hooked up to said Linux Bridge. All VMs attached 
                directly to the Bridge are assigned their own IP address on my home network
                
                To the right is my acutal Malware Analaysis Lab enviorment, 
                and to the left are other projects I am working on in the future. Following the line down is 
                a VM called pfSense, which is a firewall that manages the traffic 
                flowing in and out of my Malware Infected Enviorment. 
            </p>
            <p>  
                In short, pfSense is a open-source firewall and router software based on
                FreeBSD. It has a very powerful/ customizable platform for managing and 
                securing networks that offers loads of features and functionalities 
                (we will dive into this soon). Whats nice about pfSense is its community
                forums for guidance as it is used in both home and enterprise enviorments,
                so you can find the answer to pretty much any issue/question you might face.
            </p>
            <p>
                One step below our pfSense firewall are 2 VMs, remNUX and FlareVM. Both of these
                VMs allow us to do whats called Static and Dynamic Analysis on any malware sample we throw
                at it. More on this below. 
            </p>
